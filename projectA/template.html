        The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
        terrestrial
        animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa
        camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant
        species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements.
        Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the
        story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your creature.)
