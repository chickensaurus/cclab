                The Caboodle thrives on expansion. It oozes across the surface, spreading and consuming anything it
                comes across. Its movements are designed to maximize the area it covers to extract
                all nutrients from the land. It is believed that the creature is capable of absorbing energy from the
                fallen star it inhabits. Only time will tell what happens to the creature once it consumes its entire
                plane of existance.

                Interact through the probe by sending signals with keys or by directing the creature's attention with
                the cursor.
